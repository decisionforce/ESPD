## TL;DR

A self imitation algorithm called ESPN is proposed to solve the goal-conditioned reward sparse tasks. ESPN learns a target policy efficiently from a series of its stochastic variants in a supervised learning manner. Experiments on the MuJuCo robotics control suite show its superior performance over baseline Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and evolution strategies (ES).

Code will be made available soon.
